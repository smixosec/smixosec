👋 Hey there,

I specialize in fortifying digital infrastructure—from network defense to system hardening. My passion lies at the intersection of cybersecurity and infrastructure, where I transform vulnerabilities into strengths and challenges into learning opportunities.

 Currently: Mastering network protocols and security frameworks through hands-on labs and CTF challenges.

Always learning: Growing my skills in defensive security, automation, and infrastructure design.

Mission: Building the foundation to become a Security Engineer who not only protects systems but architects resilient digital environments.
